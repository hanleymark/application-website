                <p>
                    My name is Mark Hanley and I am a wannabe developer who believes fervently that the web must be
                    accessible to all. In particular, I want to use my personal understanding of vision loss and its
                    challenges, to build web sites that are truly accessible to vision-impaired people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also been a primary school teacher in some of the most deprived areas of inner London for over
                    twenty years. I have always been passionate about improving the life chances of the young
                    people from a wonderful array of cultures and backgrounds with whom I have been lucky enough to
                    work. As you will read in the coming paragraphs, I now have a disability that makes it harder for
                    me to meet the considerable physical demands of class teaching, but that has negligible impact on my
                    ability
                    to develop software. I would now like to combine my long-standing passion for software development
                    with my
                    extensive experience of teaching and learning. It is my ambition to develop socially responsible
                    software that supports
                    and extends children's learning in a way that is accessible to all, regardless of background or
                    disability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm going to tell you why I strongly believe that I possess the skills, experience and motivation to
                    become a key member of the next team of F&C future developers!

                <p>
                    From silly animations and games back in the distant days
                    of the home-micro revolution when I was a kid, to coding up Towers of Hanoi solutions in Excel to
                    <em>See If It Can Be Done</em>.

                <p>
                    I've always harboured the ambition to make coding my full-time job. However, having been a teacher
                    for over twenty years, I've had to fit in the fun little programming projects around my main job.
                    Consequently, my tinkering with Python, C#, Excel macros and more... has never attained the depth
                    and saturation of knowledge required to make the leap into professional software development.

                </div>
                <p>
                    On Friday 13th March 2020, while I was just about to enjoy my morning coffee before heading off to
                    work, the entire right half of my visual field in both eyes went black. Disappeared. In a matter of
                    seconds, without warning or pain, I permanently lost half my vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What I didn't know was that, while I had been sleepily preparing my coffee, a tiny blood clot had
                    formed in my body and made its way up to the visual cortex in my brain and wreaked havoc in my
                    left occipital lobe. The impact on my vision can be seen in these visual field perimetry test results...

                    Cut to now, 2022. Thanks to meds and a minor operation to patch a hole in my heart, what happened to
                    me on that day is very unlikely to happen again. It has taken time and a <em>lot</em> of learning,
                    but I have fully come to terms with my disability. Teaching young children however, with a serious
                    vision impairment, has undeniably been tough. Meeting the complex needs of a class of thirty
                    children when you can't see half of them at any one time is a constant challenge that can take its
                    toll. It's time for a change of direction. And what better way than finally to realise my ambition
                    to code as my profession.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I may have lost my vision, but it has opened my eyes. Life is short and things can change 
                    in the blink of an eye. Make time to chase your dreams.

                I was new to web development when I began the six Founders & Coders application projects. I have
                learned a colossal amount about vanilla HTML, JavaScript and CSS on my journey through them.
                I want to show this journey, warts and all. Therefore I have not gone back to the earlier projects
                to make significant changes to them using knowledge, skills and techniques that I have learned more
                recently.

                Please do use the 'More/Less' button to reveal more information about each project - I have tried
                to provide a commentary in which I summarise my key learning and what I think the next steps for each
                one
                should be. Tap or click on any of the thumbnail images to launch each project.

                                dynamically updating the
                                user on the current status of some input fields.</p>

                                learning. I decided to attempt much more ambitious CSS in order to develop a clear page
                                style.

                        <p>This was my favourite project! An almost pure JavaScript game with a small amount of
                            HTML/CSS.</p>
                        <p>I decided to have a go at creating a clone of the fiendishly difficult but addictive 2048
                            game. The game involves using the arrow keys to slide blocks, each with a number on, across
                            a grid. When two blocks of
                            the same value are slid into each other, they combine and their value doubles. Each time the
                            blocks move, a randomly generated block with a 2 or 4 value is placed in a free grid space.
                            The game is over when no more new blocks can be placed and no slides are possible. I loved
                            the
                            constant problem solving that this project brought and the challenge of developing the
                            gameplay
                            algorithms.</p>
                        <p>I would like to further develop this in the future to use CSS to draw the board rather than
                            an HTML canvas. This would enable me to focus on animating the tiles as they move. I'd also
                            like to add some kind of gesture control so that it could be played on touch devices,
                            although this feels beyond the scope of a vanilla JavaScript project like this.</p>

                            reasons why I want to join the wonderful F&C Software Developer Apprenticeship. A key area
                            to improve would
                            be the structure of the CSS as the single CSS file has grown huge and somewhat difficult to
                            follow. I would like to investigate how I can use CSS frameworks like SASS and multiple
                            separate CSS
                            files to achieve this.</p>
