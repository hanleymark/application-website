Reflection
==========

The last project! I wanted to develop a pleasing style and layout which showed many of the reasons why I want to join the wonderful F&C Software Developer Apprenticeship. A key area to improve would be the structure of the CSS as the single CSS file has grown huge and somewhat difficult to follow. I would like to investigate how I can use CSS frameworks like SASS and multiple separate CSS files to achieve this.

Key learning:

Using anchors for navigation
Fixed navigation links at the top of the page
Play CSS animations when the user scrolls them into the viewport
Further develop CSS styling
Next steps:

Structure CSS mmuch ore effectively
Ensure consistent styling on all browsers
Continue to add projects from my own learning
Become a Founder & Coders software developer apprentice!
